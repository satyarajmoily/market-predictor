# Product Context - Market Predictor

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
- **Market Volatility**: Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and unpredictable
- **Trading Decisions**: Traders need reliable, real-time price predictions to make informed decisions
- **Automation Need**: Manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to human error
- **Scalability**: Need to serve multiple clients with fast, consistent predictions

### Business Case
- Provide a **reliable prediction service** that can be consumed by trading applications
- Enable **autonomous trading systems** by providing programmatic access to predictions
- Create a **monitored and self-improving system** that gets better over time
- Support **real-time decision making** with low-latency predictions

## What Problems It Solves

### Primary Problems:
1. **Price Prediction Access**: Provide easy-to-use API for Bitcoin price predictions
2. **Reliability**: Ensure consistent availability and performance
3. **Observability**: Enable monitoring and analysis of prediction accuracy
4. **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent prediction requests
5. **Maintainability**: Support autonomous improvement and updates

### Secondary Problems:
- **Integration Complexity**: Simplify integration with trading systems
- **Model Management**: Handle prediction model lifecycle
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize prediction performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error recovery

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For API Consumers:
- **Simple Integration**: Clear, RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
- **Fast Responses**: Sub-100ms response times for predictions
- **Reliable Service**: 99%+ uptime with graceful error handling
- **Confidence Metrics**: Predictions include confidence scores and metadata

#### For System Operators:
- **Health Visibility**: Clear health status and diagnostics
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive Prometheus metrics
- **Log Analysis**: Structured logs for debugging and analysis
- **Easy Deployment**: Docker-based deployment with minimal configuration

### Core Workflows

#### Prediction Request Flow:
```
1. Client sends POST /api/v1/predict with parameters
2. Service validates request (timeframe, data points, etc.)
3. Service retrieves necessary market data
4. Model generates prediction with confidence score
5. Response cached for similar requests
6. JSON response returned with prediction + metadata
```

#### Health Check Flow:
```
1. Client sends GET /health
2. Service checks internal components
3. Quick response (< 10ms) with basic status
4. Detailed status available at /status endpoint
```

#### Monitoring Integration:
```
1. All requests generate Prometheus metrics
2. Performance data continuously collected
3. Logs structured for Loki aggregation
4. Metrics exposed at /metrics endpoint
```
