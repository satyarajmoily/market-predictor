# Active Context - Market Predictor

## Current Focus: Milestone 1 - Foundation

**Status**: Starting implementation  
**Timeline**: 7-10 days total  
**Goal**: Establish a working FastAPI prediction server with core functionality

## Current Phase: Phase 1.1 - Project Structure & Environment Setup

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1.1):
1. **Create project structure** with proper Python packaging
2. **Set up virtual environment** and dependency management
3. **Create requirements.txt** with FastAPI and core dependencies
4. **Implement Docker configuration** for containerized deployment
5. **Configure environment variable management** with .env support

### Phase 1.1 Implementation Checklist:
- [ ] Create `src/predictor/` package structure
- [ ] Implement `main.py` with FastAPI application factory
- [ ] Set up `config/settings.py` with Pydantic settings
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with core dependencies
- [ ] Create `requirements-dev.txt` with development dependencies
- [ ] Implement basic `Dockerfile` for containerization
- [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- [ ] Set up `.env.example` file with configuration template
- [ ] Create basic project README with setup instructions

### Expected Directory Structure After Phase 1.1:
```

│   └── predictor/
│       ├── __init__.py

```

## Upcoming Phases

### Phase 1.2: Core API Endpoints (2-3 days)
**Focus**: Implement main API endpoints with proper validation
- [ ] `/predict` endpoint for Bitcoin price predictions
- [ ] `/health` endpoint for service health checks
- [ ] `/status` endpoint for detailed service status
- [ ] Pydantic models for request/response validation
- [ ] Error handling and HTTP status codes

### Phase 1.3: Basic Prediction Logic Implementation (3-4 days)
**Focus**: Implement dummy prediction model and business logic
- [ ] Dummy prediction model (random walk, moving average)
- [ ] Model interface for future ML model integration
- [ ] Data validation and preprocessing
- [ ] Response caching mechanism
- [ ] Basic error handling for prediction failures

### Phase 1.4: Local Testing & Validation (1-2 days)
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- [ ] Unit tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for prediction workflow
- [ ] Load testing with sample requests
- [ ] API documentation validation
- [ ] Local deployment verification

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Recent Technical Decisions:
1. **FastAPI Framework**: Chosen for performance, type safety, and auto-documentation
2. **Pydantic V2**: Selected for configuration management and request/response validation
3. **Dummy Model Strategy**: Start with simple prediction logic to establish foundation
4. **Docker-First Approach**: Containerization from the beginning for consistency
5. **TTL Caching**: Simple time-based caching for prediction responses

### Current Questions/Unknowns:
- **Model Interface Design**: How flexible should the prediction model interface be?
- **Caching Strategy**: Should we use in-memory caching or Redis for production?
- **Metrics Granularity**: What level of detail is needed for Prometheus metrics?
- **Error Recovery**: How should the service handle prediction model failures?

### Pending Decisions:
- **Logging Format**: Structured JSON vs. standard Python logging format
- **Health Check Depth**: How comprehensive should health checks be?
- **API Versioning**: Should we implement versioning from the start?
- **Rate Limiting**: What rate limiting strategy to implement?

## Integration Context

### Relationship with Market Programmer Agent:
- **Monitoring Target**: This service will be monitored by the agent
- **Improvement Subject**: Agent will create PRs to improve this service
- **Metrics Provider**: Must expose comprehensive metrics for agent analysis
- **Health Reporting**: Must provide detailed health status for agent monitoring

### Expected Agent Integration Points:
1. **Health Monitoring**: Agent will regularly check `/health` and `/status`
2. **Metrics Scraping**: Agent will analyze Prometheus metrics from `/metrics`
3. **Log Analysis**: Agent will analyze structured logs for issues
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Agent will track response times and error rates

## Development Environment Status

### Current Setup:
- [x] Project repository structure created
- [x] Empty memory-bank directory initialized
- [ ] Python virtual environment (to be created)
- [ ] Development dependencies (to be installed)
- [ ] Docker environment (to be configured)

### Development Workflow:
1. **Phase Implementation**: Focus on one phase at a time
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component as it's built
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update memory bank as we learn and progress
4. **Agent Consideration**: Keep monitoring requirements in mind throughout

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **Scope Creep**: Temptation to add advanced features too early
   - **Mitigation**: Stick strictly to Milestone 1 phase definitions
2. **Over-Engineering**: Creating overly complex abstractions
   - **Mitigation**: Keep initial implementation simple, refactor later
3. **Integration Complexity**: Complex integration with agent requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Design clean interfaces, comprehensive documentation

### Success Criteria Validation:
- **Working Service**: FastAPI starts and responds to requests
- **Health Endpoints**: Monitoring endpoints return appropriate data
- **Docker Deployment**: Service runs correctly in container
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI docs are complete and accurate
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with good coverage

## Communication & Coordination

### Stakeholder Alignment:
- **User Requirements**: Building foundation for autonomous trading system
- **Agent Requirements**: Ensuring service is monitorable and improvable
- **System Requirements**: Meeting performance and reliability standards

### Documentation Updates:
- **Progress Tracking**: Update progress.md after each phase completion
- **Technical Changes**: Update systemPatterns.md if architectural decisions change
- **Configuration Changes**: Update techContext.md for new dependencies or setup

### Next Memory Bank Review:
- **Trigger**: After Phase 1.1 completion
- **Focus**: Update progress, capture lessons learned, plan Phase 1.2
- **Documentation**: Update activeContext.md with Phase 1.2 focus
