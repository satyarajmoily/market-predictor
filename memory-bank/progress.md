## Implementation Readiness

### Ready to Start âœ…:
- **Requirements Analysis**: Complete understanding of what to build
- **Architecture Design**: Clear system architecture and patterns defined
- **Technology Stack**: All technology choices documented and justified
- **Development Approach**: Clear phase-by-phase implementation plan
- **Success Criteria**: Defined metrics for each phase completion

### Pending Setup ðŸ”„:
- **Development Environment**: Need to create Python virtual environment
- **Dependencies Installation**: Need to install FastAPI and development tools
- **Docker Configuration**: Need to create Dockerfiles and compose files
- **Testing Framework**: Need to set up pytest and testing infrastructure

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Blockers:
- **None**: No current blockers to starting implementation

### Anticipated Challenges:
1. **Model Interface Design**: Balancing simplicity with future extensibility
2. **Caching Strategy**: Deciding between in-memory vs. Redis caching
3. **Metrics Design**: Determining optimal Prometheus metrics granularity
4. **Agent Integration**: Ensuring monitoring endpoints meet agent needs

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:
- **Incremental Development**: Build and test each component individually
- **Simple First Approach**: Start with simplest working implementation
- **Documentation First**: Document decisions and patterns as we go
- **Agent Consultation**: Consider agent monitoring needs in design decisions

## Next Immediate Actions

### Phase 1.1 - Next Session Tasks:
1. **Create Project Structure**: Set up `src/predictor/` package hierarchy
2. **Environment Setup**: Create virtual environment and install base dependencies
3. **FastAPI Skeleton**: Create minimal FastAPI application that starts
4. **Configuration Setup**: Implement Pydantic settings with environment variables
5. **Docker Foundation**: Create basic Dockerfile that builds and runs

### Expected Deliverables:
- Working Python package structure
- FastAPI application that starts and responds to basic requests
- requirements.txt with core dependencies
- Basic Dockerfile for containerization
- .env configuration template

## Success Metrics

### Milestone 1 Completion Criteria:
- [ ] FastAPI service starts without errors
- [ ] All three endpoints (`/predict`, `/health`, `/status`) respond correctly
- [ ] Prediction endpoint returns valid JSON with dummy predictions
- [ ] Service runs successfully in Docker container
- [ ] API documentation is auto-generated and complete
- [ ] Test suite passes with good coverage (>80%)

### Quality Gates:
- **Code Quality**: All code passes linting and type checking
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all components
- **Documentation**: API documentation complete and accurate
- **Performance**: Response times meet specified requirements (<100ms)
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoints provide meaningful status information

## Historical Context

### Project Genesis:
- **Vision**: Autonomous trading system with self-improving prediction service
- **Architecture**: Market predictor as target, programmer agent as improver
- **Approach**: Start with solid foundation, iterate with autonomous improvements

### Design Evolution:
- **Technology Choice**: FastAPI selected for performance and developer experience
- **Containerization**: Docker-first approach for consistent deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics integration from the beginning
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy for reliability

### Learning Outcomes:
- **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive memory bank provides clear direction
- **Phase Structure**: Breaking work into phases helps maintain focus
- **Agent Consideration**: Designing for autonomous improvement from start
- **Foundation First**: Importance of solid foundation before advanced features
